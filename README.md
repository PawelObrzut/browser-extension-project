# Browser Extension Project from Frontmentor

This is a junior level front-end project which I have completed using React-Vite with Typescript superset. Quite easy but fun and great to refreash and practice front-end skills.


## Features

The responsive layout displays a list of browser extensions that has its source in JSON format file. To track changes data is copied into a state variables hence it is quite easy to keep track of any changes.


## Themes

Despite low cmplexity of a project it was valuable as I discovered an easy way to build and switch between light and dark themes. CSS is extreamly powerful tool and fun to work with.
